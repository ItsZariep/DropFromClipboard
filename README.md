> [!NOTE]
> On some webpages, it is not possible to drag and drop images from this extension due to website internal logic. Unfortunately, there isn't much I can do about this. However, since the images are visible in the UI, you can right-click and quickly download the copied image, which is faster than going back and searching for the image source.
