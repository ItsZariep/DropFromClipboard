<h2 id="how-to-use">How To use</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy an image (not necessary from the browser).</li>
<li>Open DropFromClipboard UI and click the “Add Image” Button)</li>
<li>The picture will be saved in the DropFromClipboard local IndexedDB
(if you delete the extension or their local data, all the images will be
deleted)</li>
<li>Now you can drag and drop from drop from clipboard to the
website</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="website-ignores-the-image">Website ignores the image</h2>
<p>This is due to website internal logic, DropFromClipboard show images
as raw <code>data:image</code> because is the simplest implementation to
save the images using IndexedDB, if the website expects an actual image
or not handle raw data, it will ignore the image, sorry for the
incovenience</p>
<h2 id="supported-formats">Supported formats</h2>
<p>DropFromClipboard supports any <code>image/png</code> supported by
the user browser, common formats like PNG, JPG or WEBP works properly,
please read your browser documentation for more information.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-store-too-many-images">I want to store too many
images</h2>
<p>In theory, there is not problem and may depend on your device storage
(not a problem in any common computer).</p>
<p>Talking about the popup size (if using Browser Extension), the
browser will display a scrollbar (native behavior, not programmed by me)
when the viewport is considered too big, however, in very small screen
this may work wrong.</p>
